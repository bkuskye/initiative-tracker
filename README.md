# initiative-tracker
Simple web app to keep track of initiative in Dungeons and Dragons. See a demo at https://thedeany.github.io/initiative-tracker.

This is just a quick implementation of an idea I had.

Features:
- automatically sorts from highest to lowest initiative
- click an entry to edit
- uses localStorage to maintain the list between page reloads
